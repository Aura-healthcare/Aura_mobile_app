As much as possible we try to write issues and user stories so that they match the flags of the diagram above
## Testing

Travis CI is running after every commits and we have an overview of the code coverage using CodeCov.

## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request to AURA mobile app with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include associated unit tests. We can always use more test coverage.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
